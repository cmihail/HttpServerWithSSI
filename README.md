HttpServerWithSSI
=================

This project implements an HTTP server in Node.js with support for basic
Server Side Include (SSI).

It supports basic HEAD and GET methods, the only 2 methods required by RFC2616.
HEAD returns the same results as GET, with the exception of the body. The
server is file-based, and for directories given as URLs, the server will return
the DEFAULT_FILE ("index.html", see "lib/Constants"). If there is no default
file, the server returns 404 for both HEAD and GET.

## SSI supported directives
- "include" -> basic implementation with only one attribute named "file";
no "/" at start or ".." are allowed
- "exec" -> supports both "cgi" and "cmd" attributes; if both arguments
are supplied, only "cgi" is taken into consideration; "cgi" scripts MUST
be executable
- "printenv" -> prints environmental variables; no attributes
- SSI directives are case sensitive, and they should have the exact syntax
defined at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/ssi.html

## Implementation
The server is based on Factory Pattern in order to make it easy to easily
add or change implementations of HTTP method requests or SSI directives. SSI
directives are processed using asynchronous callback functions and a sort of
recursion. More exactly, the function SsiProcessor.processContentHelper()
processes the file content by searching for SSI directives. If any is found,
it processes the result and executes a callback with the result (the callback
is needed because of asynchronous callbacks to the file system). The callback
will call again SsiProcessor.processContentHelper() until all file content is
processed.

## NPM modules
- "argchecker" -> used to process command line arguments, like PORT and PATH
- "winston" -> logger on node.js
- "mocha" -> testing framework

## Installation / Uninstallation:
- npm install ssihttpserver [-g]
- npm uninstall ssihttpserver [-g]
- [-g] is for global

## Run:
- locally: <install_dir>/node_modules/.bin/httpServer [--port PORT] [--path PATH]
- globally: httpServer [--port PORT] [--path PATH]
- PORT and PATH are optionally
- default PORT is 8080 and default PATH is <app_dir>/serverRoot

## Usage:
```js
var HttpServer = require('ssihttpserver');

// HttpServer arguments are optionally
var httpServer = new HttpServer({
	port: [PORT],
	path: [PATH]
});

// Start server
httpServer.start();

...

// Close server
httpServer.close();
```â€Ž

## Testing
- uses "mocha" library; MUST be in the application root directory when running
"mocha"; any other directory will not work
- tests are full stack; they represents clients that connect to the server and
send different HTTP requests
- some tests will work only on UNIX Operating Systems, like the exec tests;
it uses the "ls" command, not "dir"; if on Windows, use "cygwin";
"testRoot/ssi/script.cgi" SHOULD be executable for successful run of tests
- in case of detailed information about tests, the next line should be commented
in "test/test.js":
```js
winston.remove(winston.transports.Console);
``
